## Experience Golang

## Likes

I started recently learning golang and created small CRUD application. My significant career experience is in JAVA and Spring Boot.

- Like the new cluterless experience without the world of annotations , beans , context all the bells and whistles.
- Like GORM as ORM .
- Like go-kit as the concept of Hexagonal service is embedded in philosophy.
- No more cranky long startup . 

## What I miss
- GoLand is very good IDE but no community edition available.
- Go not OOP but we can use struct and method to add some OOP like flavour, but still theres a chance to spill over code all around. 
- Automigration is good but looking for something similar to flyway in Spring , found a project migrate but it has unexpected bugs.

## Need to check
- Tracing,logging,metrics full course menu plus hystrix support, gateway , circuit breaker.
- Docker image size.
